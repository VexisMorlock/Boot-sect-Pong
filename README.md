Controls:

  W: move player up
  S: move player down
  c: Change color (default white next one is black so everything disapears)
  r: reset game

Known bugs:

  ~ When changing color the game lets you change the forground color to background color making everything invisible.
  
  ~ Keyboard repeat delay is't set well but can't really fix with size restraints
  
  ~ Visual glitches with ball when it hit screen limit
 
Future updates:

  ~ Want to add support for joysticks and fix keyboard repeat delay to add to more natural controls
  
  ~ Run in different mode to allow for larger game size
